# Amazon S3 Workshop (18.08.2021)

A repository for workshops related to the Amazon S3 service of AWS's largest cloud computing service.

## Why a workshop?

Several people I know who recently attended the Serverless with Ruby workshop (held in May) have occasionally asked about the possibility of another workshop. I decided that quite universal topic, which applies to everyone will be related to storage, which everyone uses every day.

## General

The form registration could be found [here](https://www.danielaniszkiewicz.com/amazon-s3-workshop.html).

This repository contains materials for conducting the workshop. Mainly a presentation with the most important information. The workshop will go over this step by step, and then we will work together to create S3 buckets. 

There will be a summary on the blog after the workshop.
